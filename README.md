Final project for the Reinforcement Learning class (3A) at ENSAE Paris. Our project is based on the paper _Diversity Is All You Need_ by Benjamin Eysenbach, Abhishek Gupta, Julian Ibarz, Sergey Levine (2018)

## Installation
### Build the Docker container
The code has been developped inside a Jupyter Lab Docker container allowing GPU access. The specific image is ``cschranz/gpu-jupyter:v1.3_cuda-10.1_ubuntu-18.04_python-only``. Please visit https://github.com/iot-salzburg/gpu-jupyter for further details.

You can build the container using the provided Dockerfile.

```bash
docker build . -t rl
```

The oneliner to run the container is the following one :
```bash
docker run -d --gpus all -p 8889:8888 -p 6006:6006 --name rl rl
```

Now, you have a container named ``rl`` running Jupyter Lab ! You can access it from ``http://127.0.0.1:8889``. Default password is ``gpu-jupyter``.

**Note :** The port 6006 is for ``tensorboard``. You can use ``tensorboard --logdir ./tensorboard --bind_all`` to run tensorboard.

Now, you can clone this repository :
```bash
git clone https://github.com/odulcy/DIAYN-ENSAE
```

### Miscellaneous
To run an arbitrary code in your container as a "normal" user, you can use :
```bash
docker exec -it rl bash
```

To get a root access, you can use :
```bash
docker exec -u root -it rl bash
```

### Optional dependencies

You can install ``pybulletgym`` for more environments. Please take a look at https://github.com/benelot/pybullet-gym#installing-pybullet-gym.

**Note :** you should run the commands as root inside the container to perform a system-wide installation.
